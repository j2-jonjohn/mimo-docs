# FAQ

## **What is mimo?**

mimo is a decentralized protocol with automated liquidity on IoTeX blockchain. mimo.exchange is a decentalized exchange \(DEX\) that enables peer-to-peer trading of IOTX and XRC20 assets. Powered by the IoTeX blockchain, mimo utilizes smart contracts and automated market making \(AMM\) algorithms to manage liquidity pools and connect buyers/sellers of crypto assets. Anyone can use mimo to trade and/or provide liquidity for a variety of trading pairs, including cross-chain IoTeX-Ethereum pairs like IOTX/ioBUSD.

## How does cross-chain trading work?

mimo.exchange works with [ioTube](https://tube.iotex.io/), a decentralized cross-chain bridge between IoTeX and other blockchain networks, to support cross-chain trading. For any assets supported on ioTube, they can be added to mimo in no time. At current stage, all ERC20 assests that ioTube supports are tradable on mimo.

## **Who can use mimo?**

There are three main categories of mimo users:

**- Traders:** buy and sell cryptocurrencies \(via the “Swap” tab\) 

**- Liquidity Provider:** deposit assets into smart contracts to earn liquidity mining rewards \(via the “Pool” tab\) 

**- Developers:** connect mimo to other dApps or services for instant swaps, lend/borrow, and other DeFi use cases. [Learn More](https://docs.mimo.exchange/api)

## What is a decentralized exchange \(DEX\)?

A decentralized exchange \(DEX\) is a cryptocurrency exchange which operates without a central authority. Decentralized exchanges allow peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies. Because users do not need to deposit their assets to the exchange, decentralized exchanges reduce the risk of theft from hacking of exchanges.  


## How does mimo ensure trusted trades?

mimo is powered by a set of verifiable, non-upgradeable smart contracts, which each manage a “liquidity pool” made up of on-chain reserves of IOTX/XRC20 tokens. mimo.exchange's smart contract is based on Uniswap's V1 contract, which has been widely used and tested in practise. Instead of a centralized order book used by traditional cryptocurrency exchanges, mimo utilizes an automated market maker \(AMM\) smart contract for pricing and reserve management. Traders can trade against these reserves at prices guaranteed by the AMM smart contract.

## What is Automated Market Making \(AMM\)?

Automated Market Making \(AMM\) is a way of managing a liquidity pool using algorithm. With AMM, no orderbook or waiting for order fulfillment is needed. Together with IoTeX's 5 second finality, the trades can be very lightning fast. [Learn More](https://docs.mimo.exchange/the-formulas)

## **How do I trade?**

To access mimo, you must first have an IoTeX address. You can create via ioPay, the official IoTeX wallet for Desktop and Mobile. With your ioPay open, open mimo App \(coming\) and connect your wallet. Before trading, you will need some IOTX for gas fees – luckily, mimo’s fees are very low, almost-zero! Under the “Swap” tab, you can now browse the swap rates of various trading pairs and execute trades by signing with your ioPay wallet.

## How do I participate in liquidity pools?

A liquidity provider is someone who deposits IOTX and XRC20 tokens into the pair’s liquidity pool reserves in return for pool tokens. These pool tokens represent fractional ownership of the total pool reserves, which also include all transaction fees, and can be redeemed for the underlying deposited assets at any time. Based on the price movements of the deposited assets, the value of one’s pool tokens will fluctuate – as such, liquidity providers take on price risk and are compensated with fees. 

For instructions on providing liquidity, please refer to the[ mimo user guide](https://community.iotex.io/t/mimo-managing-liquidity-pools-step-by-step-instructions/1523).

## What is the trading fees?

All trading fees are just 0.3% of source token. The fees will 100% go to liquidity pool for share among all liquidity providers.
